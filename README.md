# BlablacarRepository

A small application for trip search 
I spend around 8-9 hours on this project 
I split my project into several modules (auth, tripsearch and core) to respect the modularization principle.
I use also an authenticator for the refresh system and an interceptor for the header and authorization in requests

I spend a lot of time on the architecture around 85%, and less on the UI, it's my own choice.
If I can have more time I will transform the hardcoded strings into constants and I will update the UI.
I will create also a best error handling.
